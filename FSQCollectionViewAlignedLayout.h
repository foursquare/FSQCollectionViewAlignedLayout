 Overview:
 
 FSQCollectionViewAlignedLayout lays out collection view cells sort of like how a type setter would draw out a string,
 but with collection cells instead of font glyphs. Each section can have both a vertical and horizontal alignment
 (horizontal aligns each line relative to the whole section, vertical aligns the items within each line if they are
 different heights). It also allows you to specify distance between items in each section and between lines.
 
 Each cell can have not only a size, but insets. You can also tell it to insert "line breaks" before or
 after each cell to get things to wrap how you want.
 
 You can set defaults for section and cell styles just like you can in Flow Layout. Or you can implement delegate methods:
 
 - (FSQCollectionViewAlignedLayoutSectionAttributes*)collectionView:layout:attributesForSectionAtIndex:
 
 To return section layout information for the specified index.
 
 - (FSQCollectionViewAlignedLayoutCellAttributes*)collectionView:layout:attributesForCellAtIndexPath:
 
 To return cell layout information for the specified indexPath.
 
 - (CGSize)collectionView:layout:sizeForItemAtIndexPath:remainingLineSpace:
 
 To return the size of each cell. It passes in the remaining space on the current line, the returned size must be
 no larger than remainingLineSpace if you want it to stay on the current line (you can use this to "fill" the
 rest of the line up, which is often useful for string and image sizing purposes).
 
 Note: This layout currently only supports laying out views vertically (with a fixed collection view width).
